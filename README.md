# Endpoint for api.example-weather-app.com/location

REST API endpoint for `api.example-weather-app.com/location` used in OpenAI GPT builder.

The GPT builder was announced during OpenAI DevDay (06/11/23). You can use it to build your customized GTP. One of its features is ability to call REST API. You can add actions that call 3rd party API.

In the example API, you can select `Get weather data` endpoint. I selected it, and send prompt to GPT `What is weather in New York?`.

I got error response, because no such API exists. Below is screenshot with error response.

What I did? I bought `example-weather-app.com` domain and set simple FastAPI app with hard-coded JSON response. It is available at `https://api.example-weather-app.com/location?location=your+location`.

Now, we got correct response in OpenAI GPT builder.
